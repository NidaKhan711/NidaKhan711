👋 Hi, I'm Nida Batool. As a Fullstack Developer, I'm driven by a passion for building elegant and high-performing web applications that make a real difference.
💻 I specialize in the React/Next.js ecosystem, using TypeScript for robust code, Tailwind CSS for beautiful UIs, and Framer Motion to bring them to life with smooth animations.
🛠️ On the backend, I build powerful APIs with Node.js and Express, with a focus on integrating AI-powered features to elevate user experiences.
🎨 From end-to-end e-commerce solutions to sleek portfolios and custom business tools, I handle the entire development lifecycle—from concept to deployment.
🎯 My goal is to create impactful products that are a perfect blend of logic, design, and innovation, always focused on solving real problems for real users.
